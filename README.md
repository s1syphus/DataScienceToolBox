# DataScienceToolBox

##TODO

* Write descriptions of main ideas/purposes of general classes of machine learning algorithms
* add more details/break down the classes into subclasses
* add in optimizations of the major algorithms (not a priority)
* Write purpose paragraph, ie why I am making this
* Add in python/pseudocode example of algorithms
* make a flow-chart or something that helps decide the best algorithm for a given task
* add benchmarks - AWS EC2? That would keep it consistent
* talk about scalability/gpu speedup
* add references
* write working example code (probably for the benchmarks) - make it easily deployable to vagrant and/or EC2
* Make abbrievated/priority version - not sure if this should be seperate or just
change the ordering
