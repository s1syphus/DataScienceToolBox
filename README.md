## Purpose Paragraph
Put something here, probably change the name
Kaggle, learning,.. etc.

This document might be too large, possibly break down into several different documents
by topic. Links should solve any issues navigating


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_machine_learning_concepts

## Data Techniques
Talk about data, structure, cleanup, sources, etc

k-folds other stuff

##TODO

* Write descriptions of main ideas/purposes of general classes of machine learning algorithms
* add more details/break down the classes into subclasses
* add in optimizations of the major algorithms (not a priority)
* Write purpose paragraph, ie why I am making this
* Add in python/pseudocode example of algorithms
* make a flow-chart or something that helps decide the best algorithm for a given task
* add benchmarks - AWS EC2? That would keep it consistent
* talk about scalability/gpu speedup
* add references
* write working example code (probably for the benchmarks) - make it easily deployable to vagrant and/or EC2
* Make abbrievated/priority version - not sure if this should be seperate or just
change the ordering
